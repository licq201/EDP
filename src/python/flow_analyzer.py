SPAF - Sports Probability Analysis Framework
Flow Amplification Analysis Engine.

This module implements the probability flow amplification effect analysis,
which is one of the most powerful (and risky) analytical tools in the framework.

The amplification effect is based on:
- Time series momentum (Moskowitz et al., 2012)
- Information cascade models (Banerjee, 1992)
