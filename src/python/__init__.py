SPAF - Sports Analytics Framework

A comprehensive domain-aware, situational-awareness-driven, probability-flow-based
sports analytics optimization system.

For academic research and educational purposes only.

Example:
    >>> from spaf import ProbabilityEngine, FlowAmplificationEngine, DomainAwarenessSystem
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize engines
    >>> engine = ProbabilityEngine()
    >>> amplifier = FlowAmplificationEngine()
    >>> awareness = DomainAwarenessSystem()
    >>>
    >>> # Calculate true probability
    >>> result = engine.calculate_true_probability({
    ...     'home': 1.50,
    ...     'draw': 4.20,
    ...     'away': 6.00
    ... })
    >>> print(result.true_probabilities)
