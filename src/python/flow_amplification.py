SPAF - Sports Analytics Framework
Probability Flow Amplification Engine

This module implements the probability flow amplification effect analysis,
one of the most innovative components of the SPAF framework.

The amplification effect is based on:
- Time series momentum theory (Moskowitz et al., 2012)
- Information cascade models (Banerjee, 1992)
- Market efficiency analysis (Wolfers & Zitzewitz, 2006)
