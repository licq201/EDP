```

The system employs a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pipeline architecture**, where each layer produces structured data for downstream consumption. Core design principles derive from three methodologies:

1. **OODA Loop** (Boyd, 1987) — Observe-Orient-Decide-Act, with iterative refinement embedded in each layer
2. **Loop Engineering** — Continuous signal quality calibration through feedback loops
3. **DAG Execution** — Stateful graph execution model similar to LangGraph, with standardized protocols between nodes

### Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Agnostic** | Input sources abstracted behind unified interfaces; pipeline can connect to any probability data source |
| **Implementation Agnostic** | Probability extraction can use any vision recognition, OCR engine, or manual input |
| **Rule Aware** | All output schemes must pass rule validation before presentation |
| **Domain First** | Situational awareness guides but never overrides probability signals |

---

## Design Philosophy: OODA Loop × Loop Engineering × DAG Execution

### OODA Loop Mapping in Sports Analysis

The OODA Loop was developed by U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd (Boyd, 1987, "A Discourse on Winning and Losing"), originally for military decision-making. Its core is a **rapid perceive-orient-decide-act** closed loop.

```

**Termination Conditions**:
- All available data processed → Output final scheme
- User budget fully allocated → Output final scheme
- Dead loop detection (same data iterated without new signals) → Force stop and report

## Data Acquisition Layer

### Visual Information Extraction

Platform screenshots contain structured tabular data (probability history, score matrices, handicap lines). The extraction pipeline follows a **three-stage strategy**:

1. **Type Classification** — Determine image content type (probability table, score matrix, handicap history, etc.)
2. **Structured Extraction** — Extract numerical data while preserving temporal context (initial vs latest)
3. **Validation** — Cross-check extracted data consistency (e.g., probability monotonicity, field completeness)

> **Framework Note**: The extraction backend is pluggable. Any multimodal recognition solution, OCR engine, or manual entry system can serve as an implementation.

### Unified Data Schema

All data sources produce data artifacts conforming to a unified schema:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| match_id | string | Unique match identifier |
| teams | object | { home, away } team names |
| timestamp | datetime | Data collection timestamp |
| markets.1X2 | time series | Win/Draw/Loss true probabilities (initial→latest) |
| markets.handicap | time series | Handicap line probabilities (e.g., -1, -2, +2) |
| markets.total_goals | time series | Total goals probabilities (0, 1, 2, ..., 7+) |
| markets.correct_score | time series | Correct score probabilities (all score combinations) |

---

## Probability Analysis Engine

### True Probability

Platform probabilities embed bookmaker margin (overround). To extract **true probability**, normalization is required:

```python
P_true(outcome_i) = (1 / odds_i) / Σ(1 / odds_j) × 100%
```

**Mathematical Basis**: If a market offers probability `o_i` for outcome `i`, the implied probability is `1/o_i`. Since `Σ(1/o_j) > 1` (i.e., margin), dividing by the sum yields a normalized probability distribution where all outcomes sum to 100%.

**Academic Support**: This normalization is equivalent to a simplified variant of the **Shin method** (Shin, 1992).

### Conditional Probability

For correct score markets, calculate **directional conditional probability**:

```python
P(score | direction) = P_true(score) / Σ P_true(scores_in_direction)
```

**Question Answered**: "Given the home team wins, what is the probability of each specific score?"

### Probability Flow

Probability flow is the core concept of this framework. It measures the **change** in market true probability distribution over time:

```python
Flow(outcome) = P_true_latest(outcome) - P_true_initial(outcome)
```

| Flow | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Positive (inflow)** | Market increasingly favors this outcome |
| **Negative (outflow)** | Market moving away from this outcome |
| **Zero (stable)** | No significant information change |

**Core Insight**: Positive flow indicates informed money (or information) is accumulating toward this outcome. Magnitude (in percentage points, pp) reflects confidence strength.

## Probability Flow Amplification Effect

> ⚠️ **This chapter describes the framework's most powerful analytical tool, and also the most risky. Amplification effect is a probability analysis amplifier—it can amplify correct signals, but also incorrect ones. Must be used in conjunction with the Domain Awareness System.**

### Definition of Amplification Effect

When probability flow shows money moving from outcome A to outcome B, it typically means adjacent outcomes on the same directional gradient **are also flowing in the same direction**. This is the **Amplification Effect**.

### Amplification Score Formula

```python
Amplification_Score(outcome) =
    Base_Flow(outcome) × Directional_Consistency × Gradient_Position
```

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `Base_Flow` | Base probability flow for this outcome (pp) |
| `Directional_Consistency` | Proportion of adjacent outcomes in same direction with positive flow (0~1) |
| `Gradient_Position` | Position in probability gradient (higher probability = greater amplification potential) |

### Amplification Effect Safeguards

**Safeguard 1: Domain Awareness Validation**

Amplification effect must be cross-validated with match intelligence:

| Intelligence Assessment | Flow Direction | Amplification Verdict |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Strong team + High offensive efficiency | Positive flow toward big win | **Confirmed** ✅ |
| Strong team + Conservative style | Positive flow toward big win | **Questionable** ⚠️ |
| Weak team + Defensive vulnerabilities | Positive flow toward big win | **Enhanced** ✅✅ |
| No clear intelligence | Positive flow toward big win | **Possible** ✅ (downweighted) |

**Safeguard 2: Base Flow Threshold**

Only enable amplification effect when base flow (Base_Flow) ≥ threshold (recommended 2pp).

**Safeguard 3: Kelly Criterion Variant**

Kelly's core idea—**adjust investment proportion based on signal strength**—is borrowed for scheme design.

---

## Domain Awareness System

### Definition of Situational Awareness

**Domain Awareness** = Complete coverage of all available information sources.

**Situational Awareness** = Real-time understanding of current match context.

### Match Intelligence Integration

| Intelligence Dimension | Data Points | Weight |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Strength Indicators** | FIFA ranking, squad value, recent form | High |
| **Tactical Context** | Offensive/defensive style, goals per game, clean sheets | High |
| **Motivational Factors** | Qualification situation, pressure, squad rotation | Medium |
| **Market Consensus** | Volume distribution, expert prediction consistency | Medium |

### Signal Validation Matrix

Each probability flow signal must be cross-validated with match intelligence:

```python
Confidence = Flow_Strength × Intelligence_Support × Market_Consensus
```

| Confidence | Condition | Action |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| **High** | All three dimensions aligned | Full weight in scheme |
| **Medium** | Two dimensions aligned | Downweighted inclusion |
| **Low** | Only one dimension supporting | Only include in high-probability small-amount combinations |
| **Negative** | Dimensional conflict | Exclude or use as contrarian signal |

---

## Scheme Design Engine

### Three Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All schemes **must** satisfy the following three principles. Any scheme violating any principle **must not be output**:

| # | Principle | Implementation Rules |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Respect Probability Flow** | Each leg of each ticket must have positive probability flow. Zero-flow legs acceptable only when no positive alternative exists. **Negative-flow legs strictly prohibited.** |
| 2 | **Respect Asymmetric Returns** | Each ticket must provide meaningful return potential. Minimum target: 3x return. Conservative "safe ticket" budget not exceeding 20% of total budget. |
| 3 | **Respect Rules** | Same match different markets cannot parlay. Correct score max 4-fold. Each ticket max 99x multiplier. Each ticket max ¥20,000. |

**Priority of Three Principles**: Principle 1 > Principle 3 > Principle 2.

### Mixed Parlay Complete Rules

#### Basic Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Different matches can mix** | Different markets from different matches **can** parlay |
| **Same match cannot mix** | Different markets from same match **cannot** parlay |
| **Minimum stake** | Each combination minimum ¥2 |
| **Single ticket multiplier cap** | Single ticket maximum 99x |
| **Single ticket amount cap** | Single ticket maximum ¥20,000 |

#### Parlay Depth Limits

| Contains Correct Score/Half-Time | Max Parlay Depth |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| No | Max 8-fold |
| Contains Correct Score | Max 4-fold |
| Contains Half-Time | Max 4-fold |
| Contains Total Goals | Max 6-fold |

---

## Rule Compliance Layer

### Validation Pipeline

Each generated ticket must pass the following validation pipeline:

```
For each ticket:
  ✓ 1. No legs from same match different markets
  ✓ 2. Contains correct score/half-time → total parlay depth ≤ 4
  ✓ 3. Each stake × combinations ≤ ¥50 (single physical ticket limit)
  ✓ 4. Each stake ≥ ¥2
  ✓ 5. Multiplier ≤ 99
  ✓ 6. All legs have positive probability flow
  ✓ 7. Ticket provides meaningful upside (non-anchor tickets ≥ 3x)
```
