  "mcpServers": {
    "spaf": {
      "command": "spaf-mcp-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### `calculate_true_probability`

Calculate true probabilities from bookmaker odds by removing the overround/margin.

**Parameters:**
- `odds` (object): Dictionary mapping outcomes to decimal odds

**Example:**
```json
{
  "odds": {
    "home": 1.50,
    "draw": 4.20,
    "away": 6.00
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "true_probabilities": {
    "home": 0.632,
    "draw": 0.226,
    "away": 0.158
  },
  "overround": 0.054
}
```

**Returns:**
- Flow report with direction and significance for each outcome

---

### `calculate_amplification`

**Parameters:**
- `flow_report` (object): Flow analysis report
- `gradient_map` (object): Map of outcomes to adjacent outcomes
- `outcome_probabilities` (object): Current true probabilities
- `domain_confidence` (object, optional): Confidence scores from domain awareness

**Returns:**
- Amplification report with scores and levels

---

### `validate_scheme`

Validate a scheme against Three Principles and rules.

**Parameters:**
- `legs` (array): List of scheme legs
- `multiplier` (integer, optional): Bet multiplier (default: 1)
- `stake_per_combination` (number, optional): Stake amount (default: 2.0)

**Returns:**
- Validation result with any errors

---

### `generate_schemes`

Generate optimized schemes within budget.

**Parameters:**
- `amplification_report` (object): Amplification report
- `budget` (number): Total budget to allocate
- `match_data` (object): Match information
- `max_schemes` (integer, optional): Maximum schemes to generate (default: 10)

**Returns:**
- Scheme bundle with optimized schemes

## Usage with AI Assistants

Once configured, you can use natural language to interact with the SPAF framework:

```
User: Calculate the true probability for odds home 1.5, draw 4.2, away 6.0

AI: I'll calculate the true probabilities by removing the bookmaker margin...

[Calls calculate_true_probability tool]

The true probabilities are:
- Home: 63.2%
- Draw: 22.6%
- Away: 15.8%

The bookmaker margin (overround) is 5.4%.
```
